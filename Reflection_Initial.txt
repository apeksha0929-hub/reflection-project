Prologue
Prologue:


I woke up in the middle of nowhere.
At first, I didn’t even realise I was awake. But as I gained more consciousness, everything hurt. My head was pounding, and when I tried to move, the side of my head brushed against the ground. I winced. My hand went straight to my temple and came back wet. I squinted in the dark.
Blood. Great.
My legs were stiff and my arms heavy. I tried to remember what had happened, but my brain felt like static.
Where…where even was I?
I pushed myself up and groaned. The air was cold and smelled like rain and soil. Trees stretched out around me, tall and black. There were no buildings, no lights. Just darkness and the sound of crickets.


“What in the…” I whispered to myself. My voice sounded strange, shaky.
I looked around again, hoping for a sign. A clue, a road, something.
Nothing. Just endless trees.
Then it hit me.
Daniela.
My stomach dropped. “Daniela?” I yelled, but my voice echoed and came back empty. “Dani! Where are you?”
No answer.
Panic crawled up my throat. The last thing I remembered was… was what? We were in the car, right? Or were we walking? My mind wasn’t able to catch the memory. It was like trying to grab smoke.
I stumbled forward, calling her name over and over again, louder each time.
Still nothing.
That’s when I saw it, the faint blue glow on my wrist. My watch. I raised it closer to my face. The numbers blinked.
12:02 AM.
I froze.
No. No, no, no.
“Please no…” I whispered.
I remembered her voice suddenly, her teasing nervous laugh as she looked at me a few weeks earlier.
“If anything ever happens, remember the time— 12:02. Promise?”
And me, not taking it seriously.
“Why that specific time? It’s so random.”
She’d shrugged. “Maybe it’s not.”
Now standing here, helpless and lost, it didn’t feel random at all.
My voice cracked. I turned in circles, scanning the darkness until something shiny caught the corner of my eye. I bent down and picked it up.
A silver chain, cold against my sweaty palm. Her necklace. The one with the tiny ‘D’ pendant she had worn since forever.
“Oh my god…” I whispered. “No, no, no, please.”
I turned it over, and my breath caught. The back of the pendant had a small engraving, something I could not have noticed before, but I did now in the bright moonlight. A number. Four digits.


1202.
My heart started racing.
“Okay,” I muttered, trying to steady my breathing. “Okay. Think”
But how could I think when my head was pounding and my hands were shaking?
A rustle came from behind me. I spun around.
“Dani?”
No reply. Just wind.
“Hello?” I called again, trying to sound braver than I felt. “Is someone there?”
Nothing.
Then I heard it. Footsteps. Slow. Crunching against the gravel. Coming closer and closer.
I whispered her name once again, even though I knew those footsteps didn’t belong to her.
Then a voice. Low, calm and way too close.
“You shouldn’t be here.”
I froze. I couldn’t see who it was, just a shadow moving between the trees.
“What do you mean?” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “Where’s my friend?”
No answer.
“Please,” I said louder. “I just need to find her. She’s…she’s hurt, I think.”
The silhouette tilted their head slightly, like they were studying me. Then they muttered, “Go home. Before it is too late.”
And just like that, they were gone.
The forest went silent again, like nothing had happened. I stood there, shaking, too scared to even breathe.
Then I looked back at my watch.
12:02, still glowing faintly.
Except this time, the seconds weren’t moving.
The watch had frozen.
