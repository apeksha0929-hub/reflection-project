Prologue:


I woke up in the middle of nowhere.
At first, I didn’t even realise I was awake. But as I gained more consciousness, everything hurt. My head was pounding, and when I tried to move, the side of my head brushed against the ground. I winced. My hand went straight to my temple and came back wet. I squinted in the dark.
Blood. Great.
My legs were stiff and my arms heavy. I tried to remember what had happened, but my brain felt like static.
Where…where even was I?
I pushed myself up and groaned. The air was cold and smelled like rain and soil. Trees stretched out around me, tall and black. There were no buildings, no lights. Just darkness and the sound of crickets.


“What in the…” I whispered to myself. My voice sounded strange, shaky.
I looked around again, hoping for a sign. A clue, a road, something.
Nothing. Just endless trees.
Then it hit me.
Daniela.
My stomach dropped. “Daniela?” I yelled, but my voice echoed and came back empty. “Dani! Where are you?”
No answer.
Panic crawled up my throat. The last thing I remembered was… was what? We were in the car, right? Or were we walking? My mind wasn’t able to catch the memory. It was like trying to grab smoke.
I stumbled forward, calling her name over and over again, louder each time.
Still nothing.
That’s when I saw it, the faint blue glow on my wrist. My watch. I raised it closer to my face. The numbers blinked.
12:02 AM.
I froze.
No. No, no, no.
“Please no…” I whispered.
I remembered her voice suddenly, her teasing nervous laugh as she looked at me a few weeks earlier.
“If anything ever happens, remember the time— 12:02. Promise?”
And me, not taking it seriously.
“Why that specific time? It’s so random.”
She’d shrugged. “Maybe it’s not.”
Now standing here, helpless and lost, it didn’t feel random at all.
My voice cracked. I turned in circles, scanning the darkness until something shiny caught the corner of my eye. I bent down and picked it up.
A silver chain, cold against my sweaty palm. Her necklace. The one with the tiny ‘D’ pendant she had worn since forever.
“Oh my god…” I whispered. “No, no, no, please.”
I turned it over, and my breath caught. The back of the pendant had a small engraving, something I could not have noticed before, but I did now in the bright moonlight. A number. Four digits.


1202.
My heart started racing.
“Okay,” I muttered, trying to steady my breathing. “Okay. Think”
But how could I think when my head was pounding and my hands were shaking?
A rustle came from behind me. I spun around.
“Dani?”
No reply. Just wind.
“Hello?” I called again, trying to sound braver than I felt. “Is someone there?”
Nothing.
Then I heard it. Footsteps. Slow. Crunching against the gravel. Coming closer and closer.
I whispered her name once again, even though I knew those footsteps didn’t belong to her.
Then a voice. Low, calm and way too close.
“You shouldn’t be here.”
I froze. I couldn’t see who it was, just a shadow moving between the trees.
“What do you mean?” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “Where’s my friend?”
No answer.
“Please,” I said louder. “I just need to find her. She’s…she’s hurt, I think.”
The silhouette tilted their head slightly, like they were studying me. Then they muttered, “Go home. Before it is too late.”
And just like that, they were gone.
The forest went silent again, like nothing had happened. I stood there, shaking, too scared to even breathe.
Then I looked back at my watch.
12:02, still glowing faintly.
Except this time, the seconds weren’t moving.
The watch had frozen.

Chapter 1
Chapter 1:
The first Monday of the school year was never my favourite.
The sun hadn’t even finished rising, however the parking lot was packed, full of cars, students yelling at each other, and a random guy’s terrible playlist blasting in the area made it feel like a movie scene I didn’t want to be a part of.
I made my way out of my dad’s car. “First day of school,” I muttered,  absolutely sarcastically. “Yay.”
“Try to sound a bit more excited,” he said, grinning.
“Maybe I will after three more hours of precious sleep,” I said, shutting the door.
Then I heard her voice, bright, loud and way too energetic for 7:45 in the morning.
“Alia!”
Daniela was waving at me from across the parking lot, her backpack slipping off one shoulder. Her blonde curls bounced as she ran toward me. I swear she always looked like she belonged in some kind of movie. The kind of girl who legitimately liked first days.        
“You’re late!” She exclaimed, half laughing, half lecturing.
“I am literally ten seconds behind you,” I said.
“Exactly. Ten seconds too late.”
I rolled my eyes, but smiled anyway. That was Daniela, dramatic, bossy, but somehow impossible to stay annoyed at.
She looped her arm around mine. 
“Okay, first stop: find our form class. Second stop: see if Mr. Harris still wears those ugly brown shoes.”
I laughed. “You’ve been waiting all summer to bully that poor man’s shoes.”
“I mean, come on, someone has too.”
We walked inside the buildings, the hallways buzzing with the chaos and energy of the first day. The air smelled like coffee, paper and lavender floor cleaner. Everyone looked older somehow, even though it had only been three months.
“Did you do the summer project?” I asked.
“Define ‘do’” she shrugged.
“Daniela-“
“Relax. I copied yours. I’ll survive.”
I groaned, but we both laughed. This was us. Always late, always chaotic, but somehow fine.
At least, that’s what I thought then.


Our first two classes passed in a blur of introductions and awkward ‘What did you do this summer?’ stories. By lunch, the cafeteria was full and loud, and Daniela had already collected half the school gossip like it was her full-time job.
She leaned from across the table. “You will never guess which teacher’s back.”
“Which one? I lost count and forgot their names,” I stated.
“Elliot Rowe.”
I gaped at her. “The Elliot Rowe? As in the one who was hated by almost all his classes and moved to London last year?”
“Yup. I know, unbelievable. Why did they bring him back?”
“God knows.” I said flatly. “Wow, my life is complete.”
She smirked. “You’re such a drama queen.”
We talked about teachers, family, and summer disasters. Everything felt normal. However,  when Daniela’s phone buzzed, she frowned at the screen for a second too long.
“Who’s that?” I asked.
She locked her phone quickly. “No one. Just…wrong number.”
“You sure?”
“Positive,” she said with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Don’t worry about it.”
But I noticed that she didn’t eat much after that.


After school, we strolled home together like always. The air was warm, the sky a light shade of orange. Daniela kept peeking over her shoulder, like she thought someone was following us.
“Are you okay?” I inquired.
“Yeah I just…” she hesitated. She never does that. “Do you ever get that feeling like someone’s watching you?”
I tried to laugh it off, but I was unsuccessful. “Maybe because you’re so popular in school. Fans everywhere.
She smiled weakly. “Probably.”
As we reached my house, she halted at the gate. “Hey Alia?”
“Yeah?”
“If anything weird ever happens, promise me something, can you?”
I frowned. “Weird as in?”
“I don’t know. Just, promise me you’ll remember the time 12:02. Okay?”
I giggled. “That’s random.”
“Promise me.” She sounded serious. Not like the Dani I knew.
“Fine,” I said. “Twelve-o-two. Happy?”
She smiled again, softer this time.
 “Yeah. I am.”
I didn’t think much of it then. Just another one of Dani’s strange, dramatic comments.
But now… I wished I had asked her what she meant.
