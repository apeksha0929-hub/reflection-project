Prologue
Prologue:


I woke up in the middle of nowhere.
At first, I didn’t even realise I was awake. But as I gained more consciousness, everything hurt. My head was pounding, and when I tried to move, the side of my head brushed against the ground. I winced. My hand went straight to my temple and came back wet. I squinted in the dark.
Blood. Great.
My legs were stiff and my arms heavy. I tried to remember what had happened, but my brain felt like static.
Where…where even was I?
I pushed myself up and groaned. The air was cold and smelled like rain and soil. Trees stretched out around me, tall and black. There were no buildings, no lights. Just darkness and the sound of crickets.


“What in the…” I whispered to myself. My voice sounded strange, shaky.
I looked around again, hoping for a sign. A clue, a road, something.
Nothing. Just endless trees.
Then it hit me.
Daniela.
My stomach dropped. “Daniela?” I yelled, but my voice echoed and came back empty. “Dani! Where are you?”
No answer.
Panic crawled up my throat. The last thing I remembered was… was what? We were in the car, right? Or were we walking? My mind wasn’t able to catch the memory. It was like trying to grab smoke.
I stumbled forward, calling her name over and over again, louder each time.
Still nothing.
That’s when I saw it, the faint blue glow on my wrist. My watch. I raised it closer to my face. The numbers blinked.
12:02 AM.
I froze.
No. No, no, no.
“Please no…” I whispered.
I remembered her voice suddenly, her teasing nervous laugh as she looked at me a few weeks earlier.
“If anything ever happens, remember the time— 12:02. Promise?”
And me, not taking it seriously.
“Why that specific time? It’s so random.”
She’d shrugged. “Maybe it’s not.”
Now standing here, helpless and lost, it didn’t feel random at all.
My voice cracked. I turned in circles, scanning the darkness until something shiny caught the corner of my eye. I bent down and picked it up.
A silver chain, cold against my sweaty palm. Her necklace. The one with the tiny ‘D’ pendant she had worn since forever.
“Oh my god…” I whispered. “No, no, no, please.”
I turned it over, and my breath caught. The back of the pendant had a small engraving, something I could not have noticed before, but I did now in the bright moonlight. A number. Four digits.


1202.
My heart started racing.
“Okay,” I muttered, trying to steady my breathing. “Okay. Think”
But how could I think when my head was pounding and my hands were shaking?
A rustle came from behind me. I spun around.
“Dani?”
No reply. Just wind.
“Hello?” I called again, trying to sound braver than I felt. “Is someone there?”
Nothing.
Then I heard it. Footsteps. Slow. Crunching against the gravel. Coming closer and closer.
I whispered her name once again, even though I knew those footsteps didn’t belong to her.
Then a voice. Low, calm and way too close.
“You shouldn’t be here.”
I froze. I couldn’t see who it was, just a shadow moving between the trees.
“What do you mean?” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “Where’s my friend?”
No answer.
“Please,” I said louder. “I just need to find her. She’s…she’s hurt, I think.”
The silhouette tilted their head slightly, like they were studying me. Then they muttered, “Go home. Before it is too late.”
And just like that, they were gone.
The forest went silent again, like nothing had happened. I stood there, shaking, too scared to even breathe.
Then I looked back at my watch.
12:02, still glowing faintly.
Except this time, the seconds weren’t moving.
The watch had frozen.

Chapter 1
Chapter 1:
The first Monday of the school year was never my favourite.
The sun hadn’t even finished rising, however the parking lot was packed, full of cars, students yelling at each other, and a random guy’s terrible playlist blasting in the area made it feel like a movie scene I didn’t want to be a part of.
I made my way out of my dad’s car. “First day of school,” I muttered,  absolutely sarcastically. “Yay.”
“Try to sound a bit more excited,” he said, grinning.
“Maybe I will after three more hours of precious sleep,” I said, shutting the door.
Then I heard her voice, bright, loud and way too energetic for 7:45 in the morning.
“Alia!”
Daniela was waving at me from across the parking lot, her backpack slipping off one shoulder. Her blonde curls bounced as she ran toward me. I swear she always looked like she belonged in some kind of movie. The kind of girl who legitimately liked first days.        
“You’re late!” She exclaimed, half laughing, half lecturing.
“I am literally ten seconds behind you,” I said.
“Exactly. Ten seconds too late.”
I rolled my eyes, but smiled anyway. That was Daniela, dramatic, bossy, but somehow impossible to stay annoyed at.
She looped her arm around mine. 
“Okay, first stop: find our form class. Second stop: see if Mr. Harris still wears those ugly brown shoes.”
I laughed. “You’ve been waiting all summer to bully that poor man’s shoes.”
“I mean, come on, someone has too.”
We walked inside the buildings, the hallways buzzing with the chaos and energy of the first day. The air smelled like coffee, paper and lavender floor cleaner. Everyone looked older somehow, even though it had only been three months.
“Did you do the summer project?” I asked.
“Define ‘do’” she shrugged.
“Daniela-“
“Relax. I copied yours. I’ll survive.”
I groaned, but we both laughed. This was us. Always late, always chaotic, but somehow fine.
At least, that’s what I thought then.


Our first two classes passed in a blur of introductions and awkward ‘What did you do this summer?’ stories. By lunch, the cafeteria was full and loud, and Daniela had already collected half the school gossip like it was her full-time job.
She leaned from across the table. “You will never guess which teacher’s back.”
“Which one? I lost count and forgot their names,” I stated.
“Elliot Rowe.”
I gaped at her. “The Elliot Rowe? As in the one who was hated by almost all his classes and moved to London last year?”
“Yup. I know, unbelievable. Why did they bring him back?”
“God knows.” I said flatly. “Wow, my life is complete.”
She smirked. “You’re such a drama queen.”
We talked about teachers, family, and summer disasters. Everything felt normal. However,  when Daniela’s phone buzzed, she frowned at the screen for a second too long.
“Who’s that?” I asked.
She locked her phone quickly. “No one. Just…wrong number.”
“You sure?”
“Positive,” she said with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Don’t worry about it.”
But I noticed that she didn’t eat much after that.


After school, we strolled home together like always. The air was warm, the sky a light shade of orange. Daniela kept peeking over her shoulder, like she thought someone was following us.
“Are you okay?” I inquired.
“Yeah I just…” she hesitated. She never does that. “Do you ever get that feeling like someone’s watching you?”
I tried to laugh it off, but I was unsuccessful. “Maybe because you’re so popular in school. Fans everywhere.
She smiled weakly. “Probably.”
As we reached my house, she halted at the gate. “Hey Alia?”
“Yeah?”
“If anything weird ever happens, promise me something, can you?”
I frowned. “Weird as in?”
“I don’t know. Just, promise me you’ll remember the time 12:02. Okay?”
I giggled. “That’s random.”
“Promise me.” She sounded serious. Not like the Dani I knew.
“Fine,” I said. “Twelve-o-two. Happy?”
She smiled again, softer this time.
 “Yeah. I am.”
I didn’t think much of it then. Just another one of Dani’s strange, dramatic comments.
But now… I wished I had asked her what she meant.

========================================================================================================



Chapter 2
Chapter 2:
My dad’s Mac and Cheese never tasted so bland.
Usually, and almost every time, Mac and Cheese was mine and Daniela’s most favourite play date snack. We used to eat and talk and play and do lots of other activities with our bowls. However, something felt…different.
“Daniela. Daniela. Dani. DANIELA!” I yelped so suddenly that she had to look up from her phone to realise what had happened.
“What?” She groaned. She clearly wasn't paying attention to what I was saying.
“You’ve been staring at the rectangle for literally the past ten minutes,” I pointed out.
This wasn’t like her.
“Oh, I’m just…reading. Yes, I’m reading.” She hesitated.
“Reading what?” I asked, already suspicious.
“It's just a blog,” she said too casually, as if something wasn't up with her. “Something for school.”
“Since when did you start reading for school?” I teased, trying to sound light.
Neither did she laugh nor did she even crack a small smile.
I frowned. Dani always laughed at everything I said, even my terrible jokes. But right now, she looked stiff, almost tense.
“Okay…” I said slowly. “So, do you wanna do something o-”
“Actually, I should get going soon.”
“What? You just got here!”
“I know, but my mom just texted. She needs me to uhm…help with something.”
“Something,” I raised my eyebrows.
“Yes, something.” She forced a tiny smile and stood up, already grabbing her bag.
I gazed at her for a moment. Something about her moments felt…off. She was moving slower, like she had to think about every step.
And then I noticed it.
A small, tiny detail nobody else would have.
A small detail that made my heart stop for a second.
The mole on her right cheek, the one we used to joke about, ‘was her beauty mark’.
It wasn't there.
It was gone.
At first, I thought maybe the light was weird. So I leaned forward. “Did you cover up your mole with makeup or something?”
Daniela froze mid-step.
“What?”
“Your mole. It’s gone.”
Daniela’s face went blank for a moment too long. Then she gave a tiny giggle. “Oh, yeah. Makeup. I used a new concealer.”
“Since when did you start wearing concealer?
“Since… today?” She phrased it like a question, then quickly added, “Anyway, I really have to go.”
Before I could ask more, she was already at the door, ready to go.


After she left, I sat there with my half-finished Mac and Cheese, staring at my phone.
Her half-eaten bowl was still on the table, cheese starting to dry on the edges. Daniela never wasted food. Never.
Just that moment, as I started to zone out, my phone buzzed.
A message.


From Daniela
Hey, sorry I couldn’t come today. My mom’s sick so I stayed home. 
Plan next weekend?


I stared at the text, rereading it at least 5 times.
My stomach went cold.
I slowly turned my head toward the table. The still warm bowl. The empty chair.
Then I looked back at my phone.
I couldn’t come today.
I didn’t even realise I was whispering when I said, “Then who was just here with me, right now, in my house?”

========================================================================================================



Chapter 3
Chapter 3:
No. That couldn’t be right.
She had just been here, sitting on my chair, barely eating Mac and Cheese, scrolling endlessly, and saying ‘reading’ like it was the world’s biggest lie.
I realised, once again, that I was holding my breath when my phone buzzed again, snapping me back to reality. A random ad popped up, and I jumped so hard that I almost threw my phone across the table.
“Calm down, Alia,” I muttered to myself, trying to laugh, but it came out shaky. “You’re just tired. Maybe she texted by mistake.
I typed out a reply anyway:
Wait, what? Weren't you literally just here like fifteen minutes ago??
The three little dots appeared, disappeared, and appeared again finally, reading:
I think you’re mixing something up. I haven’t left my house all day.
I didn’t answer. I just stared. My throat felt dry.


The next morning, everything was too normal. The kind of normal which felt fake.
The sun was out, the kids were yelling near the bus stop, and my dad was burning toast like usual. But my brain was still playing yesterday’s scenario on loop.
When I got to school, Daniela was at her locker like nothing had happened, even though a lot had. Same hair, same outfit as yesterday. Even the same scrunchie.
“Hey!” She said cheerfully, like the weirdest 24-hours of my life hadn’t happened.
I forced a grin. “Hey…how’s your mom?”
She blinked. “My mom?”
“Yeah. You texted last night. Said she was sick.”
“Oh. Right.” She paused for a moment, then nodded. “She’s fine now.”
She said it like she had to remember the line.


We walked to class together, and for a few minutes I almost convinced myself everything was okay. But when she leaned down to tie her shoe, her hair shifted, and I saw it again.
No mole.
Not a faint one. Not covered-up. Just…gone.
I swallowed hard. “Are you, uh, still using that concealer?”
“What?”
“The one you said hides your mole.”
“Oh,” she said, her smile not reaching her eyes. “Yeah. Works great, right?”
Her tone was too light. Too careful, and too noticeable to see that something was definitely off.
That’s when I noticed the necklace.
A thin, silver chain with a tiny ‘D’ charm, her favourite one, the one she’d had since forever. I knew that necklace. I had given it to her for her 13th birthday.
But, last night, when she left my house, she hadn’t been wearing it. I remembered, I knew, because I almost asked why.
Now she was.
Everything inside me screamed that something was wrong, but I didn’t say anything. Not yet.


After school, I walked home alone without Daniela, as I had told her I had to go grocery shopping on purpose, so she didn't get suspicious. The sun had set early, painting the street and sky a smoky-like grey. The wind smelled like rain, and my brain wouldn’t stop spinning.


Who was that in my house?
Why would Daniela lie?
And how could she be texting me from her house and sitting across from me at the same time?


I kicked a pebble, hard. It rolled to the side of the pavement and hit something small and shiny.
What a coincidence.
I bent down and froze.
A necklace.
A thin, silver chain with a small ‘D’ charm. The exact same one Daniela was wearing today.
At first, I thought it was just a coincidence, lots of people had the letter ‘D’ on their necklaces. But the more I looked at it, the more familiar it seemed.
It wasn’t a copy. It was hers.


I remembered the tiny scratch on the edge, the one from when she dropped it in the cafeteria last year. It was right there. The same mark.
I picked it up slowly, the cold metal resting in my palm.
If Daniela was wearing hers right now…how could this one be here?
My stomach tightened.
I wanted to look closer, to investigate the charm, to make sure I wasn’t imagining things. But something in me was afraid to know.
So I shoved it into my pocket and kept walking.


I reached my house five minutes after I found the chain. My walk had been full of curious thoughts and hurried conclusions of recent events. 
I needed to know what’s happening.
I was starting to zone out all over again, until I snapped back to earth. The reason being a stranger leaning down to my cat, Furby.
“Hey!” I said, my voice coming out a bit louder than I meant it to be.
He looked up, startled, a hand half-raised mid-pet. “Oh, sorry! I wasn’t trying to steal your cat or anything.”
I blinked. He had a soft smile, messy pale, blond hair, and heterochromic eyes that looked like they were constantly inquisitive and always trying to figure something out. Furby, who usually hissed at everyone, was happily purring at his feet.
“Wow,” I said slowly. “She doesn’t usually let anyone touch her that easily.”
“Guess I’m special,” he said with a grin, standing up and brushing his jeans of Furby’s black and brown fur. “Or maybe she just likes good company.”
I raised an eyebrow. “Or maybe Furby doesn’t realise you’re a stranger.”
He laughed, hands sliding into his pockets. “Fair point. I’m Ace, by the way. Just moved into the house across the street this morning.”
Now that he mentioned it, there had been a moving truck earlier this week. Boxes still sat near the front porch.
“Oh,” I said. “I’m Alia.”
“Nice to meet you, Alia.” He looked down at my cat's collar. “And apparently, Furby.”
“Great,” I muttered, crossing my arms. “Even my cat is making friends faster than I am.”
Ace smiled. “If it helps, I don’t know anyone here either. Unless you and your cat counts.”
That made me laugh. A small, but real laugh. The first one in days.
“So,” he said after a moment, “you look like you’ve had a long day.”
“You have no idea,” I said, glancing at my pocket, where the pendant sat like a secret I couldn’t let go of.
“Well, if you ever need a distraction,” Ace said, “I’m good at being one. And I make pretty decent coffee. “
I smirked. “I’ll keep that in mind.”
He gave me a small wave before heading back toward his driveway. Furby meowed after him, tail flicking.
I unlocked my front door and turned back to see him one last time. He was still walking, but when he reached his porch, he looked back at me, just for a split second, and smiled.


Somehow, that simple smile made my world feel a little less strange. It seemed to reassure me that I may have a friend I can trust.


========================================================================================================

Chapter 4
Chapter 4:
 It’s odd how quickly someone can go from stranger to comfort.
Within two weeks, Ace and I had somehow turned into the kind of friends who texted random memes at midnight and fought over who made the better instant noodles. He said he definitely did, although I knew he definitely didn’t.
He was funny in that quiet, clever way. The type who didn’t talk much but noticed everything. The way Furby would stick out her tongue at times, or how I always tried and avoided the right side of the street because that’s where I had found the chain. He didn’t ask why, but I could tell he wanted to know.
And maybe that’s why, one evening, I finally told him.
We were sitting on the curb outside my house, sharing a bag of chips with “BIRDS OF A FEATHER” by Billie Eilish playing on a low volume from the speakers in my garden, watching the sky turn rose-pink. My father had called Ace's parents over for dinner as they are new here. My dad wanted to introduce himself to them and make them his friends, as this specific street was usually lonely. The world looked too calm for the storm I had been carrying inside me.
“Okay,” I said, crumpling the chip bag in my hands. “This is going to sound completely insane.”
He grinned. “You already sound insane most of the time. Go ahead.”
“Ha-ha,” I said flatly, then took a breath. “It’s about Daniela.”
His grin faded. “Your best friend?”
“Yeah,” I nodded, eyes on the street. “I think something’s wrong with her.”
“Wrong like…she’s mad at you?”
“No. Wrong like she’s not herself anymore.”
Ace blinked. “Not her, as in-“
I interrupted and told him everything. The weird texting. The missing mole. The fake laugh. The second necklace. The odd feelings.
By the time I finished, he wasn’t laughing anymore.
He just sat there quietly, tapping the crumpled bag of empty chips against his leg.
After a long pause, he said, “Okay, that’s…a lot.”
“I know it sounds crazy and I understand if you don’t believe me,” I added quickly. “I’ve tried telling myself that I’m just overthinking, but things just don’t add up.”
“I don’t think you’re crazy,” he said finally. “I think you’re onto something.”
I blinked. “Wait, really?”
He shrugged. “I mean, look, I just moved here, but I've even heard things about this town. Weird things. People disappearing, stories getting buried. If your friend’s acting strange, maybe there’s a reason.”
That’s when I realised that there was something in his voice. A strange seriousness I hadn’t heard before.
“You’ve heard things?” I asked.
He hesitated, then stood up. “You should meet my sister.”
“Your sister?” I got on my feet too.
“Maya,” he stated. “She’s older. Knows more about… stuff like this.”


The next day, he took me to his house.
Maya was nothing like Ace.
She was loud, blunt, and had the kind of confidence that made people turn when she walked in a room.
When I met her that weekend, she was sitting cross-legged on their porch, surrounded by notebooks and iced coffee cups. Her brunette hair was tied back into a bun, her eyes blue, bright, but mysterious.
“So you’re Alia,” she said, squinting at me. “The girl who thinks her friend’s been replaced.
I glanced over at Ace. “You told her?”
“Hey,” he said defensively. “She doesn’t keep secrets. Trust me, it’s easier to just let her in.”
Maya grinned. “Don’t worry. I’m not here to make fun of you. I’m here because I love mysteries. And if something’s up, we're going to find out what. “
Ace handed her my phone. “Show her the texts.”
She scrolled through silently, then looked up. “These messages aren’t normal.”
I frowned. “How can you tell?”
“Because the typing pattern’s different from her previous texts. The spacing, the punctuation. Whoever sent this one,” she said, tapping the message that said I couldn't come today, “isn’t the same person who came to your house that night.”
I stared. “You can tell that?”
“Yeah,” Maya exclaimed, half-laughing. “I read way too much true crime.”
Ace laughed. “She really does.”
For the first time in weeks, I felt something almost like relief. Maybe I wasn’t completely alone in this anymore.


The next Monday at school, things felt… lighter.
Having Ace and Maya made the whole thing seem less impossible. We even started a private investigation group chat named Operation D (Ace came up with the name. It was terrible.)
Still, Daniela was everywhere. Smiling, talking, acting like nothing was wrong. Everyone believed she was fine. Everyone except for me.
Then, on Wednesday, I opened my locker, and what I found sent a chill down my spine.
A small folded piece of paper sat on top of my books. My name was written with familiar handwriting. Looping and neat.
I unfolded it slowly.


Arrête de traîner avec elle, 
petite luciole.


My heart stopped.
Stop hanging out with her, you little firefly.
Luciole.
Firefly in French.
Firefly was what Dani used to call me when we were kids. She said I glowed whenever I got excited about something.
Not one other soul knew that nickname. Not my dad. Not Ace. No one.
I read it again, my fingers trembling. At the bottom of the paper, in English this time, was something else.


You’re digging in the wrong place.
I stuffed the note into my jean’s pocket and slammed my locker shut, my pulse hammering in my ears.
Who left that note?
And what did they mean by wrong place?
The bell rang, making me jump. Daniela, or whoever she was, walked past me, smiling, waving like always.
“Hey, Firefly,” she said casually, voice smooth as ever.
I stared at her, frozen at the spot.
“See you at lunch?” She added, eyes bright.
For a second, I swore I saw something cold behind that smile. Something knowing.
She walked away before I could answer.
I leaned against my locker, despite the fact that I knew I was going to be late for Chem.
If this wasn’t Daniela…
Then whoever she was knew exactly who I was.
